Bay Area Salon is a fictional Hair Salon offering various services from hair cuts to coloring. 
The website is reponsive for most devices large and small, though by no means perfect. The Website is mostly HTML/CSS; Javascript was used on the contact page to connect it firebase.
The contact page Divya made connects to firebase; however, the Google Calendar Dylan made does not--only to his school email.

Thanks for Reading!!!
