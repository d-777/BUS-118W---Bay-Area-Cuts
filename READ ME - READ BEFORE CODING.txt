READ BEFORE CODING!!!!!!!!!!

So Who's doing what.... 

Dylan  - homepage & booking page
Chris  - gallery
Evelyn - services
Divya  - contact (plus Figma design)

Of Course, there will be collaboration if someone needs help!!

	1) When will we be meeting...

Check Discord for updates, but either Wednesdays before class
or if that does not work, Friday mornings (personally perferred).

 	2) How will the work get done...

Each member should work on their respective page before we meet up.
We should all share the html files with each other 
	so we can all be on the "same page" when developing.
	Sharing individaul files will be through Discord or email, whichever is preferred.

	3)What about Live Share during meetup...

I can host a Live Share session on VS Code so we can edit together; after that,
	 I'll reemail a zipped file with those changes that we collaborated on 
	 so everyone can continue thier individual pages. 

Thanks for Reading!!!
